				About GameDAO
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				GameDAO Protocol is an experimental decentralised protocol for fundraising, coordination and ownership of video games.
				It is developed by GameDAO AG, based in Liechtenstein, Zero Reality AG in Switzerland and various contributors around the world.
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				GameDAO Protocol is built on top of substrate, a cutting edge blockchain SDK by Parity, with interoperability, scalability, robustness and security in mind.
				It is deployed on zero.io, a video games multichain, and collaborates with partner networks in the Polkadot ecosystem, like acala.network.
			</Typography>

			<Typography variant="h3" pb={[2,4]}>
				Primitives for open markets
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				GameDAO Protocol provides primitives for invocation and operation of decentralised organisations (DAOs),
				utilisation of decentralised finance (DeFi) instruments for fundraising and non-fungible token (NFT)
				to provide a comprehensive solution for license management and projects related loot drops.
				The protocol is designed and operated in a decentralised fashion, enabling programmatic access to everyone.
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				GameDAO also develops a decentralised application frontend accessible through https://app.gamedao.co,
				to enable non technical entities to utilise these protocols with some additional safeguards,
				making them usable in a reasonable, secure and compliant way.
			</Typography>

			<Typography variant="h3" pb={[2,4]}>
				Community owned by design
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				The protocols and application assemble to a low barrier, community governed discovery and curation platform,
				involving the community as a key stakeholder and funding contributors in project coordination to increase mutual trust due to shared interests
				and increased transparency. This allows for early stage market proof and loyalty through ownership.
			</Typography>

			<Typography pb={[2,4]}>
				This shall contribute to the individual freedom of the community and the creation of more
				sustainable business models of video games and the cyberspace in general.
			</Typography>

			<Typography variant="h3" pb={[2,4]}>
				GameDAO: the protocol directly connecting gamers, creators, publishers and investors.
